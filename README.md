# OBS Stream Intro
This will help you create a dynamic intro screen for your stream. It will show a random background and play random music. It has rain or snow that can be displayed on the intro. This intro is used on videos on [The Vintage Gamers](http://www.TheVintageGamers.com "The Vintage Gamers") videos on  [YouTube](https://gaming.youtube.com/TheVintageGamersCom "The Vintage Gamers YouTube") and [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/TheVintageGamers "The Vintage Gamers Twitch").
